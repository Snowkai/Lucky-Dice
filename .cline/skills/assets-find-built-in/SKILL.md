# Assets / Find (Built-in)

Search the built-in assets of the Unity Editor located in the built-in resources: Resources/unity_builtin_extra. Doesn't support GUIDs since built-in assets do not have them.

## Inputs

- `name` (optional) — case-insensitive name fragment. Underscores, hyphens, spaces, and periods delimit search words so partial-word matching works.
- `type` (optional) — restrict results to assets assignable to this type (e.g. `UnityEngine.Texture2D`).
- `maxResults` — cap on returned list size (default 10).

## Ranking

Results are sorted by descending match quality: exact match → substring match → all-words match → partial-words match. Within a rank, results are sorted alphabetically by filename for stable ordering.

## How to Call

```bash
unity-mcp-cli run-tool assets-find-built-in --input '{
  "name": "string_value",
  "type": "string_value",
  "maxResults": 0
}'
```

> For complex input (multi-line strings, code), save the JSON to a file and use:
> ```bash
> unity-mcp-cli run-tool assets-find-built-in --input-file args.json
> ```
>
> Or pipe via stdin (recommended):
> ```bash
> unity-mcp-cli run-tool assets-find-built-in --input-file - <<'EOF'
> {"param": "value"}
> EOF
> ```


### Troubleshooting

If `unity-mcp-cli` is not found, either install it globally (`npm install -g unity-mcp-cli`) or use `npx unity-mcp-cli` instead.
Read the /unity-initial-setup skill for detailed installation instructions.

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | No | The name of the asset to filter by. |
| `type` | `any` | No | The type of the asset to filter by. |
| `maxResults` | `integer` | No | Maximum number of assets to return. If the number of found assets exceeds this limit, the result will be truncated. |

### Input JSON Schema
