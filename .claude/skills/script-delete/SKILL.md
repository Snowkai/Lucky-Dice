name: script-delete
description: Delete one or more `.cs` script files from disk, refresh the AssetDatabase, and wait for Unity compilation to settle before delivering the final result via the request's `requestId`. Pair with 'script-read' to inspect files before deletion.
---

# Script / Delete

Delete the script file(s). Does AssetDatabase.Refresh() and waits for Unity compilation to complete before reporting results. Use 'script-read' tool to read existing script files first.

## Inputs

- `files` — non-empty array of `.cs` paths. Every entry must exist on disk.
- `requestId` — required for the processing/delivered-later contract.

## Behavior

Validates the array (non-empty, every entry ends with `.cs`, every entry exists). Deletes each file plus its sibling `.meta` (when present). Calls `AssetDatabase.Refresh` and schedules a post-compilation notification — the final response is delivered after Unity finishes the recompile triggered by the delete.

## How to Call

```bash
unity-mcp-cli run-tool script-delete --input '{
  "files": "string_value"
}'
```

> For complex input (multi-line strings, code), save the JSON to a file and use:
> ```bash
> unity-mcp-cli run-tool script-delete --input-file args.json
> ```
>
> Or pipe via stdin (recommended):
> ```bash
> unity-mcp-cli run-tool script-delete --input-file - <<'EOF'
> {"param": "value"}
> EOF
> ```


### Troubleshooting

If `unity-mcp-cli` is not found, either install it globally (`npm install -g unity-mcp-cli`) or use `npx unity-mcp-cli` instead.
Read the /unity-initial-setup skill for detailed installation instructions.

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `files` | `any` | Yes | File paths to the files. Sample: "Assets/Scripts/MyScript.cs". |

### Input JSON Schema

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "files": {
      "$ref": "#/$defs/System.String-1"
    }
  },
  "$defs": {
    "System.String-1": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "files"
  ]
}
```
