# Assets / Find

Search the asset database using the search filter string. Allows you to search for Assets. The string argument can provide names, labels or types (classnames).

## Filter syntax

- **Name** — filter assets by their filename (without extension). Words separated by whitespace are treated as separate name searches.
- **Labels (`l:`)** — assets can have labels attached. Use `l:` before each label.
- **Types (`t:`)** — find assets based on explicitly identified types. Available types include AnimationClip, AudioClip, AudioMixer, ComputeShader, Font, GUISkin, Material, Mesh, Model, PhysicMaterial, Prefab, Scene, Script, Shader, Sprite, Texture, VideoClip, VisualEffectAsset, VisualEffectSubgraph.
- **AssetBundles (`b:`)** — find assets which are part of an Asset bundle.
- **Area (`a:`)** — find assets in a specific area. Valid values: `all`, `assets`, `packages`.
- **Globbing (`glob:`)** — use globbing to match specific rules.

Searching is case-insensitive. Use `searchInFolders` to restrict the search scope. `maxResults` caps the returned list (default 10) — results beyond it are truncated.

## How to Call

```bash
unity-mcp-cli run-tool assets-find --input '{
  "filter": "string_value",
  "searchInFolders": "string_value",
  "maxResults": 0
}'
```

> For complex input (multi-line strings, code), save the JSON to a file and use:
> ```bash
> unity-mcp-cli run-tool assets-find --input-file args.json
> ```
>
> Or pipe via stdin (recommended):
> ```bash
> unity-mcp-cli run-tool assets-find --input-file - <<'EOF'
> {"param": "value"}
> EOF
> ```


### Troubleshooting

If `unity-mcp-cli` is not found, either install it globally (`npm install -g unity-mcp-cli`) or use `npx unity-mcp-cli` instead.
Read the /unity-initial-setup skill for detailed installation instructions.

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `filter` | `string` | No | The filter string can contain search data. Could be empty. Name: Filter assets by their filename (without extension). Words separated by whitespace are treated as separate name searches. Labels (l:): Assets can have labels attached to them. Use 'l:' before each label. Types (t:): Find assets based on explicitly identified types. Use 't:' keyword. Available types: AnimationClip, AudioClip, AudioMixer, ComputeShader, Font, GUISkin, Material, Mesh, Model, PhysicMaterial, Prefab, Scene, Script, Shader, Sprite, Texture, VideoClip, VisualEffectAsset, VisualEffectSubgraph. AssetBundles (b:): Find assets which are part of an Asset bundle. Area (a:): Find assets in a specific area. Valid values are 'all', 'assets', and 'packages'. Globbing (glob:): Use globbing to match specific rules. Note: Searching is case insensitive. |
| `searchInFolders` | `any` | No | The folders where the search will start. If null, the search will be performed in all folders. |
| `maxResults` | `integer` | No | Maximum number of assets to return. If the number of found assets exceeds this limit, the result will be truncated. |
