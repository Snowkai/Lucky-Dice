description: Delete the assets at the given project paths. Refreshes the AssetDatabase at the end. Use 'assets-find' to locate the assets first.

# Assets / Delete

Delete the assets at paths from the project. Does AssetDatabase.Refresh() at the end. Use 'assets-find' tool to find assets before deleting.

## Inputs

- `paths` — project-relative asset paths to delete. Must be non-empty.

## Behavior

Routes through `AssetDatabase.DeleteAssets`, which deletes the batch atomically. Paths Unity reports as failed are surfaced in `response.Errors`; successfully deleted paths are surfaced in `response.DeletedPaths`. The tool is destructive (removes files from disk).

## How to Call

```bash
unity-mcp-cli run-tool assets-delete --input '{
  "paths": "string_value"
}'
```

> For complex input (multi-line strings, code), save the JSON to a file and use:
> ```bash
> unity-mcp-cli run-tool assets-delete --input-file args.json
> ```
>
> Or pipe via stdin (recommended):
> ```bash
> unity-mcp-cli run-tool assets-delete --input-file - <<'EOF'
> {"param": "value"}
> EOF
> ```


### Troubleshooting

If `unity-mcp-cli` is not found, either install it globally (`npm install -g unity-mcp-cli`) or use `npx unity-mcp-cli` instead.
Read the /unity-initial-setup skill for detailed installation instructions.

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
